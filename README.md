  - Filtering, Sorting
  - Joins (INNER, LEFT, etc.)
  - Aggregates (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.)
  - Subqueries
  - Grouping with HAVING
  - Data from specific periods, customers, products
- ✅ Structured and clean data insertions for reproducible results
- ✅ Easy to import into **SQL Server / SSMS**
